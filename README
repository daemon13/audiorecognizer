Shazam in java

Roy van Rijn has written wonderful post about Shazam algorithm 
and how to implement it on our own. To do this he placed many 
chunks of his project source code, but he did not upload all 
source code of his application because as he stated:

The Shazam patent holders lawyers are sending me emails to 
stop me from releasing the code and removing this blogpost.

It occurred that core of this algorithm is very simple. I have 
analyzed his post and as weekend project I have written simple 
Proof-Of-Concept application which outputs its findings to 
console. It gives surprisingly correct answers. For now I have 
tested 10 different mp3 audio files and this application was 
able to recognize each of them. Application is learning basing 
on path to mp3 file on your local disk or http stream of mp3 
file from any source and recognize by sound from microphone. 
I have uploaded my source code to github.
